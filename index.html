          <h3>Beat That!</h3>
          <p>"Beat That!" is a solo project that was created after two weeks of learning the fundamentals. It is a quick
            dice game in which the goal is to roll the dice and play the highest number that can be created to beat the
            CPU. Feel free to play the game <a

          <p>"Farm-to-table" is a partner project with one other developer that utilizes the MEN stack with the deadline
            of one week. The idea behind this project was to connect customers to local farms in order to purchase fresh
            produce. My contributions include stylizing of client-side interface and user authentication.</p>

          <h3>X-games collab</h3>
          <p>Created with one other developer and one UX designer, we were given less than two days to collaborate and
            create a mobile-friendly app that would handle a subscription form and allow the "business" to view how many
            email sign-ups they receive via the dashboard. My focus was on both the frontend and backend for the form
            validation.</p>

          <h3>Dream Keebs</h3>
          <p>Dream Keebs is a project that I hope to develop into a powerful tool for both new and old keyboard enthusiasts. It allows the user to sign in and keep track of the keyboards they already have and the ones they would love to create. The user can also keep track of any interest checks or group buys they are interested in. While the parts in the database are currently bare, it aims to be a community-driven application where the users can contribute by adding various parts with their description. Visit the website <a
